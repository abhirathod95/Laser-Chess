Laser-Chess

By Daniel Zhang and Abhi Rathod.

Laser-Chess is a strategic board game where two players take turns moving mirrored pieces
around the board, utilizing their laser and the reflection of the pieces' mirrors to 
destroy their opponent's Pharoah and win the game.

The game begins with all pieces set up in a predefined starting configuration. Each turn, 
a player must move one of their pieces one tile in any direction or rotate an owned piece
by 90 degrees. At the end of a player's turn, their laser will fire automatically.
Any piece struck by the laser on a non-mirrored side will be destroyed and removed from 
the board.

Pharaoh (1 per player)
The most important piece. The objective of the game is to direct a laser into your
opponent's Pharaoh, destroying it and thus winning you the match. No special properties
other than its active/destroyed status deciding the victor.

Scarab (per player)
This piece holds a diagonally oriented, two sided mirror. Thus, it is unable to be destroyed
since there is no way to direct a laser to a non mirrored side of the piece. Scarabs may
move into an already occupied tile, switching places with the previous occupant of the tile.
These versatile pieces are small in number and are typically the key to gaining an 
advantage during the course of a match.

Anubis (per player) 
An Anubis is a defensive piece that is indestructible from the front, although its two
sides and rear are vulnerable to attack.

Pyramid (per player)
The Pyramid holds a single-sided, diagonally oriented mirror, making it vulnerable from two 
sides. They make up the bulk of pieces that a player will control.

Sphinx (1 per player)
The Sphinx is unique in that it may not move, only rotate. Each player's Sphinx is located
in the corner of the board, opposite the other. The laser fires from the front of the 
Sphinx at the end of its owner's turn. Sphinxes are invulnerable to laser blasts.
